1) edit the 'envs.json' file for your email account
2) run 'python make_crypt.py'. This should create a file 'envs.crypt'
3) delete 'envs.json'
4) go through 'mail_check.py' and make sure all the absolute paths 
    are ok
5) add your own python functions to files in the commands folder, 
    the function name and the file must match

Every time the script runs, it should decrypt the 'envs.crypt' file
and put them into the python process's environment variables. The 
script will then query the environment variables for addresses and 
passwords.

Example cron:
01 * * * * /usr/bin/python /home/pi/scripts/raspi/mail/mail_check.py > /home/pi/crontab_output.txt

You can now send yourself emails where the subject is "CMD: <arbitrary 
text> and the body is something like <cmd>%<arguments>
